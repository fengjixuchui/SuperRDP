SuperRDP is a new version rdpwarp base on the [rdpwrap](https://github.com/stascorp/rdpwrap) by [stascorp](https://github.com/stascorp).

Thanks for [stascorp](https://github.com/stascorp) so much.

SuperRDP is written in C, and rebuild the code about patch and hook.

I'm very dependent on the Remote Desktop service, so I will keep updating to support for the new version of termsrv.
